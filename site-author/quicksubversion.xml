                If you use Eclipse as your development environment, there is a plugin available
                which enables you to use Subversion from within Eclipse (ie it is a Subversion
                client for Eclipse).  This plugin is called Subclipse and it is located at:
                <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://subclipse.tigris.org/','http://subclipse.tigris.org/');</script>

                If you use Windows on your systems, there is also a graphical client implemented as an
                        extension to the Windows shell, called TortoiseSVN:

                                If it worked, you will see all the files as they
                                checkout followed by a revision number - this is the
                                version of the tree that you have (useful for comparing notes)
